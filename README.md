# First-Byte

## What We Did:
We conducted data analysis to support the growth of B/YTÉ, a fictional fashion company presented to us in the UBC Bolt Datathon "First Byte". 
The analysis conducted is related to three key problems: a lack of differentation from B/YTÉ's key competititors, ineffective supply chain management, and 
lack of fit with current digital trends in the retail space.

## What We Used:
We used Python to conduct all analysis. Additional libraries used include plotly and pandas. 

## What we learned:
- How to effectively clean data
- How to use pandas functions to improve data usability
- How to use plotly to create user-friendly visuals
