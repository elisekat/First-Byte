# First-Byte

## What We Did:
We conducted data analysis to support the growth of B/YTÃ‰, a fictional fashion company presented to us in the UBC Bolt Datathon "First Byte". 
The analysis conducted is related to three key problems we identified: a lack of differentation from B/YTÃ‰'s key competititors, ineffective supply chain management, and 
lack of fit with current digital trends in the retail space.

UPDATE: We won third place! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

## What We Used:
We used Python and Jupyter Notebook to conduct all analysis. Additional libraries used include plotly and pandas. 

## What We Learned:
- Matching data analysis to business problems
- Effectively cleaning data
- Using pandas functions to improve data usability
- Using plotly functions  to create user-friendly visuals
- Using Jupyter Notebook functionality for easier access to data visualizations
